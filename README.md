## Installation
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tanishparmar/Insurance-Price-Predition.git

2. Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

python app.py

This will start the Flask server on your local machine. You can then use the web interface to enter the details of a person and get the predicted insurance price.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information on various factors that can influence insurance price, such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoker/non-smoker, etc. 

## Model
The machine learning model used in this project is a regression model. It is built using scikit-learn library in Python. The model is trained on the insurance dataset and used to predict the insurance price based on input features.
